# Dimensionality-Reduction-to-forecast-stock-market
Forecasting daily stock market return using dimensionality reduction on financial indicators

The goal of this project was to predict the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) direction.

1) (data_preprocessing.ipyb)
Firstly we chose to focus on 60 financial indicators (SPY returns, EMA, interest rates, Stocks, etc …) between 2003 and 2013. We downloaded this data from multiple sources : Yahoo finance (SPY and Indexes), Federal Reserve Board of Governors (T Bills, interest rates…), Commodities specialized websites. We then applied calculations to get new variables (returns and EMA), and then we focused on cleaning of the data (replacing NaN values, getting rid of outliers).
